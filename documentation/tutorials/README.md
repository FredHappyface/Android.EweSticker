## Step 1 - Create Sticker Directory (and transfer to device)

The sticker directory has the following structure:

```none
/root
     /sticker-pack-name-1
                         /sticker-1
                         /sticker-2
     /sticker-pack-name-2
                         /sticker-1
                         /sticker-2
```

Then transfer this to your phone/ device. Plugging this into a PC is a pretty
convenient way to do this.

**NOTE:** that the maximum pack size is currently **128** and the total maximum number of stickers supported
is **4096**
